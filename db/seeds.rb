# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  user = User.create([{ username: 'Star Wars' }, { password: 'Lord of the Rings' },{password_confirmation: 'asdlfj'}])
  user = User.create([{ username: 'Stsdfsdar Wars' }, { password: 'sdfhe Rings' },{password_confirmation: 'asdlfj'}])
  user = User.create([{ username: 'Star Wasdfdssdfsrs' }, { password: 'Lord of the Ringasdfsds' },{password_confirmation: 'asdlfsdfds'}])


  #   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
